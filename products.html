                        <p>Both the Global Business Company (GBC) and the Authorised Company (AC) provide a high level of confidentiality. The choice between the two structures depends on several factors, including the nature of the proposed activities and the target markets.</p>
                        
                        <p>A GBC is considered tax resident in Mauritius and, subject to meeting prescribed substance requirements, may benefit from the network of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) to which Mauritius is a party. A GBC is permitted to conduct a portion of its business within the domestic market, provided that the majority of its operations are carried out outside of Mauritius.</p>
                        
                        <p>Conversely, an AC is generally treated as non-resident for tax purposes in Mauritius and is therefore not subject to Mauritian income tax. This structure is commonly used in situations where access to tax treaty benefits is not required. Both the GBC and AC are versatile vehicles that can be used for a wide range of activities, including investment holding (such as SPVs) and trading.</p>

                        <h1>Trust</h1>
                        <p>A trust typically involves three key parties: the settlor (or grantor), the trustees, and the beneficiaries. The settlor is the original owner of the assets and establishes the trust by formally transferring specified assets into it.</p>
                        
                        <p>The trustees are appointed to manage and administer the trust assets in accordance with the terms of the trust deed. They hold legal title to the assets and have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries, both current and future.</p>
                        
                        <p>Trust structures offer considerable flexibility and control, allowing the settlor to define how, when, and under what conditions the trust assets are to be used or distributed for the benefit of the beneficiaries.</p>

                        <h1>Foundations</h1>
                        <p>The ability to establish and administer Foundations in Mauritius further enhances the jurisdiction's reputation as a leading platform for wealth management, succession, and estate planning.</p>
                        
                        <p>A Foundation, which possesses legal personality and shares certain features with a traditional company, offers a familiar and flexible structure for individuals and families seeking to preserve and manage wealth across generations.</p>
                        
                        <p>A Foundation is created by a Founder who endows it with assets. Its objectives may be charitable, non-charitable, or a combination of both. These objectives can be directed towards specific individuals, a class of persons, or to achieve a defined purpose. The Founder's intentions are typically outlined in a Charter, which sets out how the assets should be administered and for what purposes or beneficiaries. While the objectives may be broadly defined, the decision-making framework must be clearly specified.</p>
                        
                        <p>Foundations are commonly used for asset protection, inheritance and succession planning, wealth preservation, charitable initiatives, and general asset holding.</p>

                        <h1>Funds</h1>
                        <p>In Mauritius, funds are typically structured as companies, limited partnerships, or protected cell companies, and may be established as either open-ended or closed-end funds in accordance with the Securities Act 2005.</p>
                        
                        <p>A fund may be self-managed or appoint a Collective Investment Scheme (CIS) Manager, subject to the approval of the Financial Services Commission (FSC). While appointing a CIS Manager is not mandatory, most funds opt to establish a CIS Manager (also referred to as an Investment Manager) in Mauritius to oversee the management of the fund. This approach can enhance the fund's tax residency status in Mauritius.</p>
                        
                        <p>To obtain a licence from the FSC, the promoters and key stakeholders of the Investment Manager must demonstrate a proven track record in fund management and comply with the necessary regulatory requirements.</p>

                        <h1>Protected Cell Company</h1>
                        <p>A Protected Cell Company (PCC) is a unique corporate structure whereby a single legal entity consists of a core and multiple independent Cells, each with segregated assets and liabilities. This structure ensures that the liabilities of one Cell do not affect the assets of another, providing a strong ring-fencing mechanism.</p>
                        
                        <p>In Mauritius, PCCs are governed by the Protected Cell Companies Act 1999 and the Protected Cell Companies (Amendment of Schedule) Regulations 2005.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Key Features of a PCC:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A PCC may establish one or more individual Cells.</li>
                            <li>The PCC is considered a single legal person, despite having multiple Cells.</li>
                            <li>The creation of a Cell within a PCC does not constitute a separate legal entity.</li>
                            <li>A PCC's assets are classified as either Cellular Assets (allocated to a specific Cell) or Non-Cellular (Core) Assets (held by the PCC itself).</li>
                            <li>The PCC may issue Cell Shares, which are linked specifically to individual Cells.</li>
                            <li>Cellular dividends may be paid in respect of Cell Shares, ensuring profits and returns are isolated to the relevant Cell.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>This structure is particularly beneficial for investment funds, insurance businesses, and structured finance vehicles where asset and liability segregation is key.</p>

                        <h1>Variable Capital Company</h1>
                        <p>The Variable Capital Company (VCC) is a flexible corporate structure that can operate either as a standalone entity or as an umbrella vehicle housing multiple sub-funds and Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs).</p>
                        
                        <p>The VCC is particularly advantageous for fund managers with diverse investment strategies, as it allows the establishment of various sub-fundsâ€”each of which may operate as either open-ended or closed-end fundsâ€”under a single legal entity.</p>
                        
                        <p>One of the key efficiencies of the VCC structure is the ability for the VCC, its sub-funds, and SPVs to share the same board of directors, fund manager, CIS administrator, and other service providers. This consolidated framework can significantly reduce operational and administrative costs.</p>
                        
                        <p>For greater independence and governance, the sub-funds and SPVs within a VCC may elect to have separate legal personality and appoint their own board of directors.</p>

                        <h1>Limited Partnership</h1>
                        <p>A Limited Partnership is a hybrid structure that combines elements of a traditional partnership with features of a private limited company. It offers the flexibility of a partnership while benefiting from a separate legal identity, making it a versatile vehicle for various investment and business purposes.</p>
                        
                        <p>A Limited Partnership must consist of at least one General Partner (GP) and one Limited Partner (LP):</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The General Partner</strong> is responsible for managing the business and affairs of the Limited Partnership. The GP has full authority to act on behalf of the partnership and to execute documents or bind the Limited Partnership in any way.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Limited Partner's</strong> role is passive, and their liability is limited to the amount of capital contributed or agreed to be contributed. LPs cannot execute documents or bind the Limited Partnership in any way.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>Key Advantages of the Limited Partnership Structure:</strong></p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tax Transparency:</strong> Limited Partnerships are generally treated as tax-transparent, meaning the partners are taxed individually on their share of income. However, the partnership may elect to be taxed as an entity on its taxable income.</li>
                            <li><strong>Limited Liability:</strong> The liability of LPs is strictly limited to their capital contributions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> The GP handles all day-to-day management, allowing LPs to remain uninvolved in operations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Equal Ranking:</strong> LPs rank pari passu in respect of the return of their capital contributions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>This structure is particularly suited for private equity, venture capital, and investment holding vehicles.</p>

                        <h1>Domestic Company</h1>
                        <p>A Domestic Companyâ€”also referred to as a Local Companyâ€”is a company incorporated under the Mauritius Companies Act 2001 and is considered resident for tax purposes in Mauritius. As a resident entity, it may benefit from the network of Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) to which Mauritius is a party.</p>
                        
                        <p>Domestic companies are subject to a flat corporate tax rate of 15% on their chargeable income. Additionally, Mauritius does not levy any withholding tax on capital gains, dividends, or impose exchange controls, enhancing its appeal as a business-friendly jurisdiction.</p>
                        
                        <p>A Domestic Company may be structured as either a Private or Public Company, and it can take one of the following five legal forms:</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Types of Domestic Companies:</strong></p>

                            <li><strong>Company Limited by Shares</strong><br>
                            A company in which shareholders' liability is limited by its constitution to any unpaid amount on the shares held.</li>

                        <p>An IBC is prohibited from engaging in business within Seychelles, and as such, it is not subject to local taxation on its income. This makes the IBC an attractive vehicle for cross-border trade, investment holding, asset protection, and wealth management.</p>

Their activities are subject to tighter regulatory constraints.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Unrestricted Investment Advisors:</strong> These advisors have broader licenses that allow them to offer advice on a wide range of investment products without restrictions. They have the ability to serve a wider range of clients, including individuals, corporations, and trusts. They are also subject to regular audits and regulatory oversight by the FSC.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>VAITOS (Virtual Asset and Initial Token Offering Services) in Mauritius refers to the services associated with the issuance, management, and trading of virtual assets, such as cryptocurrencies and tokens, in compliance with the country's regulatory framework. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) regulates virtual assets in Mauritius, and the jurisdiction has created a supportive environment for businesses in the FinTech and blockchain industries, positioning itself as a hub for Initial Token Offerings (ITOs).</p>
                        
                        <p>Mauritius has introduced the Virtual Asset and Initial Token Offering Services Act, which provides a legal and regulatory framework for companies engaging in virtual asset activities. The Act covers:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Issuance of Tokens:</strong> Companies conducting Initial Token Offerings (ITOs) must comply with strict guidelines to ensure transparency and safeguard investor interests.</li>
                            <li><strong>Virtual Asset Custodianship:</strong> The Act also outlines the responsibilities of virtual asset service providers, including how digital assets should be securely held and managed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Companies involved in VAITOS are required to register with the FSC and meet anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) requirements.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Mauritius' clear regulatory stance in the virtual asset space ensures that businesses and investors can operate with confidence while also contributing to the growth of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
